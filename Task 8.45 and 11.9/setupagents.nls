; File with functionality regarding the setup of agents

; FILE HISTORY:

; 2023-04-10 Template created by gks
; 2023-04-14 Change current_state to idle, Group 8 (Ingvar Pétursson, Hampus Oxenholt, Adam Makowski)
; 2023-04-27 Group 4 (Anton, Marcus & Andreas)
; - added the temporary state go-to-work to test the states
; - added placeOfWork variable which is initialized with a place to work (intializing just for testing currently)
; - added vision_range 5 where less than that will crash the program. This is because the agent needs to be able to move and lower than 5 would cause an agent in the
;   middle of the townsquare to have no available patches thus crashing. The size of the townsquare is connected to the create-building size parameter in setupenvironment.nls.
; 2023-04-14 Added the template beliefs, Group 8 (Ingvar Pétursson, Hampus Oxenholt)
; 2023-05-02 Changed the start states, Group 8 (Ingvar Pétursson, Hampus Oxenholt)
; 2023-05-12 Group 3 Anna Selstam, Malin Ramkull, Wael Mahrous: 
; - Changed initiation values for frustration and fear, and added initiations for activist-label
; - Added variables for cops and for one chief
